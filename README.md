# Torch
*Simple and lightweight torch for android*         

### Why?
- Flashlight apps in store are full of unnecessary ads and permissions, analytics, and very heavy for no reason.         
- Needed an app for simple daily use.         

### TODO
- [ ] Fix delay in turning on flash.         
- [ ] Support for phones without flash.
